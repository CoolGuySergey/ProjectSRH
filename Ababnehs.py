# Ababnehâ€™s test between 2 sequences

# The remaining of general symmetry breakage is attributable to breakage of internal symmetry. Ababneh's = Bowker's - Stuarts

# (n -1)(n-2)/2 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of categories. If S_I^2 < 0.05, there are changes in the relative substitution rates between the root-to-tip axis of the tree or between lineages. Obtaining the data by chance under global homogeneity (assumption III) is unlikely.
