    MaxSym_int test. The remaining of general symmetry breakage is attributable to breakage of internal symmetry. Ababneh's = Bowker's - Stuarts. < 0.05, there are changes in the relative substitution rates between the root-to-tip axis of the tree or between lineages. Obtaining the data by chance under global homogeneity (assumption III) is unlikely.
